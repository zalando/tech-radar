To reduce the number of programming languages in use, we recommend to reduce the use of Java. Java is a great language
, but in engineering we have good knowledge in Node.js. Also, we maintain sharded libraries for
various use cases, and we need to maintain and implement them also for java.

Our "Hold" recommendation is reinforced by significant security concerns. The **State of DevSecOps Report 2025** highlights that Java services have a disproportionately high rate of known, exploitable vulnerabilities and a slower patching cadence compared to other ecosystems. This presents a critical risk, and for any new projects, safer alternatives should be prioritized.
