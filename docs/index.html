            <h3>What is the Tech Radar?</h3>
            <p>
                The Neofonie Tech Radar is a list of technologies, complemented by an assessment result, called
                <i>ring assignment</i>. We use four rings with the following semantics:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>ADOPT</b> &mdash; Technologies we have high confidence in to serve our purpose, also in large scale.
                    Technologies with a usage culture in our Neofonie production environment, low risk and recommended to
                    be widely used.</li>
                <li>
                    <b>TRIAL</b> &mdash; Technologies that we have seen work with success in project work to solve a real problem;
                    first serious usage experience that confirm benefits and can uncover limitations. TRIAL technologies
                    are slightly more risky; some engineers in our organization walked this path and will share knowledge
                    and experiences.</li>
                <li>
                    <b>ASSESS</b> &mdash; Technologies that are promising and have clear potential value-add for us; technologies
                    worth to invest some research and prototyping efforts in to see if it has impact. ASSESS technologies
                    have higher risks; they are often brand new and highly unproven in our organisation. You will find some
                    engineers that have knowledge in the technology and promote it, you may even find teams that have started
                    a prototyping effort.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>HOLD</b> &mdash; Technologies not recommended to be used for new projects. Technologies that we think
                    are not (yet) worth to (further) invest in. HOLD technologies should not be used for new projects, but
                    usually can be continued for existing projects.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>What is the purpose?</h3>
            <p>
                The Tech Radar is a tool to inspire and support engineering teams at Neofonie to pick the best technologies for new projects;
                it provides a platform to share knowledge and experience in technologies, to reflect on technology decisions
                and continuously evolve our technology landscape. Based on the
                <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar">pioneering work of ThoughtWorks</a>, our Tech Radar sets out the changes in technologies that are interesting
                in software development &mdash; changes that we think our engineering teams should pay attention to and consider
                using in their projects.
            </p>
            <h3>How do we maintain it?</h3>
            <p>
                The Tech Radar is maintained by some developers at Neofonie committed to devote time to the Tech Radar purpose. The developers
                self organise to maintain the Tech Radar documents, including this public version. Assignment of technologies
                to rings is the outcome of ring change proposals, which are discussed and voted on in guild meetings. The
                Tech Radar depends on active participation and input from all engineering teams at Neofonie.

                    <a href="https://github.com/zalando/tech-radar">open sourced the code</a> to generate this visualization.</i>
