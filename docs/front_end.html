<h2>Frameworks</h2>

<p><strong>ApolloClient</strong>: Apollo Client is a state management library for JavaScript
that enables us to manage both local and remote data with GraphQL. It makes it easy to
fetch, cache, and modify application data.</p>

<p><strong>D3</strong>: Data-Driven Documents (D3) is a JavaScript library that allows us to
bind data to a Document Object Model (DOM), and apply data-driven transformations to the
document. It's highly flexible and used primarily for creating data visualizations.</p>

<p><strong>ESLint</strong>: ESLint is a static code analysis tool for identifying problematic
patterns in JavaScript code. We use it to enforce a consistent coding style and catch
errors or bad practices early.</p>

<p><strong>Honeybadger</strong>: Honeybadger is an exception monitoring service that helps us
catch and manage errors in our web applications. It provides real-time error alerting and
reporting.</p>

<p><strong>MaterialUI</strong>: Material-UI is a React UI framework that follows Google's
Material Design guidelines. It offers a set of React components that make it easier to
create attractive, consistent designs.</p>

<p><strong>Prettier</strong>: Prettier is an opinionated code formatter that supports
multiple languages. It automatically formats our code to ensure that it follows a
consistent style.</p>

<p><strong>SASS/SCSS</strong>: Syntactically Awesome StyleSheets (SASS) is a preprocessor
scripting language that is interpreted into Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). SCSS is the
modern syntax for SASS and allows us to use variables, nested rules, and more, making our
CSS more maintainable.</p>

<p><strong>Storybook</strong>: Storybook is a tool for developing UI components in isolation.
It serves as a playground and documentation platform, allowing us to visually test and
showcase components.</p>

<p><strong>Underscore</strong>: Underscore is a JavaScript library that provides a host of
functional programming helpers without extending any built-in objects. It's useful for
tasks like iterating over arrays and objects, manipulating data, and more.</p>

<p><strong>Grunt</strong>: Grunt is a JavaScript task runner that automates repetitive tasks
like minification, compilation, and unit testing. It uses a command-line interface to run
custom tasks defined in a Gruntfile.</p>

<p><strong>jQuery</strong>: jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It
simplifies things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, and
animation, making it easier to work with front-end development.</p>

<p><strong>Lodash</strong>: Lodash is a JavaScript utility library similar to Underscore, but
with some additional capabilities. It provides utility functions for common programming
tasks using a functional programming paradigm.</p>

<p><strong>Moment</strong>: Moment is a library that allows us to parse, validate,
manipulate, and display dates and times in JavaScript. It simplifies working with
date-related tasks in our applications.</p>

<p><strong>Lerna</strong>: Lerna isn't a language but a tool that optimizes the workflow
around managing multi-package repositories with Git and npm. It's often used in large
projects to manage multiple interdependent packages within a single repository, making it
easier for us to develop, test, and publish those packages.</p>

<h2>Languages</h2>

<p><strong>JavaScript</strong>: JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted scripting language
that is widely used for building web-based applications. It allows us to create dynamic,
interactive experiences on the client side but is also now extensively used for
server-side development, thanks to environments like Node.js.</p>

<p><strong>Lerna</strong>: Lerna isn't a language but a tool that optimizes the workflow
around managing multi-package repositories with Git and npm. It's often used in large
projects to manage multiple interdependent packages within a single repository, making it
easier for us to develop, test, and publish those packages.</p>

<p><strong>TypeScript</strong>: TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds optional
static typing. It's designed to catch type-related errors during development, making our
code more robust and maintainable. It gets compiled down to standard JavaScript, allowing
it to run in any JavaScript environment.</p>

<p><strong>CoffeeScript</strong>: CoffeeScript is a programming language that compiles into
JavaScript. It offers more concise syntax and additional features not native to
JavaScript, making it easier to write clean and readable code. However, its popularity has
declined with the advent of ES6+ features in JavaScript.</p>

<h2>Testing</h2>

<p><strong>Chromatic</strong>: Chromatic is a visual testing tool for UI components and
libraries. It integrates with Storybook and allows us to automatically capture snapshots
of our components, helping to catch visual regressions during development.</p>

<p><strong>Enzyme</strong>: Enzyme is a JavaScript testing utility for React that makes it
easier for us to manipulate and traverse our React Component's output. It's commonly used
for unit testing React components and provides APIs for simulating user interactions.</p>

<p><strong>Jest</strong>: Jest is a popular testing framework for JavaScript, known for its
simplicity and zero-config setup. We use it for unit tests, integration tests, and
snapshot testing. Its watch mode and mocking capabilities make testing more efficient.</p>

<p><strong>React Testing Library</strong>: This library is focused on testing React
components in a way that closely resembles how they would be used in a real application.
Rather than testing implementation details, we use it to test the rendered output and user
interactions.</p>

<p><strong>Playwright</strong>: Playwright is a Node.js library for end-to-end testing of web
applications. It provides a high-level API for automating web browsers across various
platforms and is capable of capturing screenshots, creating PDFs, and more.</p>

<p><strong>Cypress</strong>: Cypress is an end-to-end testing framework for web applications.
It offers a robust, all-in-one testing environment that runs in the browser, making it
easier for us to set up, write, run and debug tests.</p>

<p><strong>Jasmine</strong>: Jasmine is a behavior-driven development (BDD) framework for
JavaScript. It's commonly used for testing the logic of our JavaScript code. It does not
rely on browsers, DOM, or any JavaScript framework, making it well-suited for server-side
JavaScript tests as well.</p>

<p><strong>Karma</strong>: Karma is a test runner for JavaScript that can execute tests in
multiple real browsers. It's often used in combination with other testing libraries and
frameworks like Jasmine, Mocha, and QUnit. It helps us ensure that our code works on all
browsers we aim to support.</p>


<h2>Libraries</h2>

<p><strong>Titan</strong>: "That turn-key accelerant for frontend development" -- Titan is a
frontend development-focused monorepository built to enable the rapid development,
testing, and deployment of components and applications.</p>

<p><strong>GitHub Actions</strong>: While not strictly a framework, GitHub Actions is a CI/CD
and automation tool integrated into GitHub's platform. It allows us to automate a variety
of software workflows, including building, testing, and deploying applications directly
within our GitHub repositories.</p>

<p><strong>NodeJS</strong>: Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript
engine. It allows us to execute JavaScript server-side, and is commonly used for building
back-end services like APIs, among other server-side tasks.</p>

<p><strong>React</strong>: React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Developed by Facebook, it enables us to create reusable UI components and manage the state
and life cycle of those components in web applications.</p>

<p><strong>Webpack</strong>: Webpack is a static module bundler for modern JavaScript
applications. It compiles our code and assets like images, CSS into one or more bundles
that are optimized, minified, and ready to be served in a web application.</p>

<p><strong>Backdraft</strong>: Backdraft is a lesser-known framework for building scalable
and maintainable large-scale web applications. It aims to provide a set of abstractions
and utilities that simplify the complexities associated with building enterprise-grade
applications.</p>
